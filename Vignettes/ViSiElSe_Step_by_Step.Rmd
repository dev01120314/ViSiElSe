## Few words about ViSiElse

VisiElse is a graphical tool designed to visualize and to give an overview of behavioural observations realized on individuals and/or groups. ViSiElse allows visualization of raw data extracted from experimental observations. For example during the realization of a procedure like a medical algorithm. It graphically presents an overview of individuals and group actions usually acquired from timestamps during video recorded sessions. Options of the package allow adding graphical information as statistical indicators (mean, standard deviation, quantiles or statistical tests) but also for each action green or black zones providing visual information about the accuracy of the realized actions.

# A step by step example 

Let’s say we want to look at people making coffee. On the basis of this simple example everybody could experience, we are presenting how to create the corresponding artificial data in order to provide a simple and clear overview of this package. … 

## The process : Making coffee

The process underlying making coffee corresponds to a 5 steps procedure.

  * 1- Taking the coffee
  * 2- Fill the machine with coffee
  * 3- Fill the tank with water
  * 4- Push the Button
  * 5- Drink the coffee

All those actions are punctual.

## The Dataset 

If people were actually making coffee, we will record when they do each punctual actions and stock it as a data.frame. In addition this data.frame must have a column to __identify individuals__. 
 
 
```{r,fig.show='asis',fig.width=7, fig.height=5,warning=FALSE}
coffee <- c(  58, 11, 5, 53, 53, 59, 24, 59, 46, 20)
fill_coffee <- c(162, 57, 103, 154, 165, 132, 74, 107, 104,  93)
fill_water <- c(  66,  92, 54, 78, 74, 114, 91, 129, 71, 56)
push_B <- c( 74, 99, 62, 84, 83, 120, 95, 129, 80, 63 )
drink <- c( 472, 176, 475, 283, 265, 207, 234, 184, 490, 520)
X <- data.frame(id = seq(1,10), coffee, fill_coffee,fill_water,push_B,drink)
head(X)
```

## First plot

Executions of punctual actions are distributed on the axis of time divided in intervals. The amount of individuals having done the action in an interval is represented by intensity of color.

By default :

  * The order of Actions in the process is given by columns of the dataset 
  * Pixel of time is set to 20 
  * The time units are seconds
  * Median and quartiles are drawn

```{r,echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ViSiElse)
```
```{r,fig.show='asis',fig.width=7, fig.height=5, warning=FALSE}
visi1 <- visielse(X)
```

On the graphic, actions are represented one under the other and their executions are distributed along the time axis. A drawn rectangle means that at least one individual has done the action in this interval of time. More a rectangle is drawn dark; more individuals have done this action at this moment.

### The parameter : pixel 

For punctual actions time is divided by intervals of size given by the parameter pixel (by default a pixel corresponds to 20 seconds). Data are aggregated into those intervals and ViSiElSe plots how many people have done an action in each pixel.
When the parameter pixel is too small  the information represented will be too much aggregated to allow interpretation if we choose a pixel smaller, more precise rectangles will be drawn but each of them will aggregate less individuals, otherwise if we choose a larger pixel less rectangles will be drawn and they will aggregate more people but they will be larger and less precise.

#### Changing the pixel of time : smaller
```{r,fig.show='asis',fig.width=7, fig.height=5, warning=FALSE}
visi1 <- visielse(X, pixel = 5)
```

#### Changing the pixel of time : larger
```{r,fig.show='asis',fig.width=7, fig.height=5, warning=FALSE}
visi1 <- visielse(X, pixel = 80)
```

### Indicators 

To help interpretation, ViSiElse proposes by default to plot as white circles median and quartiles, it is also possible to plot mean and standard deviation or nothing at all.

#### Plot Mean and standard deviation
```{r,fig.show='asis',fig.width=6, fig.height=3, warning=FALSE}
visi1 <- visielse(X,informer = "mean")
```

#### Do not plot indicators 
```{r,fig.show='asis',fig.width=6, fig.height=3, warning=FALSE}
visi1 <- visielse(X,informer = NULL)
```

## The ViSibook

The ViSibook is the object containing information on the behavioral process whereas the dataset contains its realizations. This ViSibook contains the structure of the behavioral process: Actions composing it, constraint of times…
When it is not manually defined the function visielse computes it by assuming the process is the ordered list of punctual actions given by the dataset colnames. Also, it is possible either to extract the ViSibook from an execution of the visielse function.

### Extraction of the ViSibook from the data
```{r,fig.width=7, fig.height=3.5}
visi1 <- visielse(X,informer = NULL, doplot = FALSE)
book <- visi1@book
plot(book)
```

The ViSibook obtained orders action as they appear in the dataset X.

### Structure of a ViSibook

A ViSibook is a class of object, and it must follow structural rules. Basically it is a data.frame with particular columns.
The __minimum structure for a ViSibook__ must give for __each action__ its __name__ (without special characters but " _ " ), its __label__, its __type__ (punctual or long), its __order in the behavioral process__, and two other information “deb” and “fin”, that should not be specified for punctual actions.


I will explain later how to deal with "deb" and "fin".  


```{r,fig.show='asis',fig.width=7, fig.height=5, warning=FALSE}
book
```

#### Changing labels
When producing an output, it is often preferred to use label instead of names of variables. By default, labels are the names of variables which are the dataset colnames, but labels can be changed and functions plot.ViSigrid and plot.ViSibook use labels for drawings.

```{r,fig.show='asis',fig.width=7, fig.height=5, warning=FALSE}
book[,2] <- c("Taking the coffee",
"Fill the machine with coffee",
"Fill the tank with water",
"Push the Button",
"Drink the coffee")
book
plot(book)
visi1 <- visielse(X, book=book, is.ViSibook = TRUE,informer = NULL)
```



### Order of Actions in the process
As explained above, the order is given by “showorder”. It is the order by which actions are supposed to happen. As long as an order is set, it does not affect calculation, it only change where it is plotted.

#### Change the order
```{r,fig.show='asis',fig.width=7, fig.height=5, warning=FALSE}
book[,4]<- c(5,1,2,4,3)
plot(book)
visi1 <- visielse(X, book=book, is.ViSibook = TRUE)
```

#### Ignored an action in the plot

To ignored an action you only have to set its order to “NA”, and it will not be computed.

```{r,fig.show='asis',fig.width=7, fig.height=5, warning=FALSE}
book[,4]<- c(NA,1,2,3,4)
plot(book)
visi1 <- visielse(X, book=book, is.ViSibook = TRUE)
```

## Long Actions

Until now we had only considered punctual actions. However ViSiElse considers two different types of actions: __punctual and long__. The actions called punctual are brief actions defined as time points, like “Push the button”. 

The actions called long (or delays) are the ones defined by a __duration__. Delays or long actions can be helpful to understand a behavioral process. They are characterized by both __a beginning punctual action and an ending one__. To define a long action there is no need to change the dataset, only to add a line in the visibook. The slot typeA in the visibook specifies if the action is punctual (“p”) or long (“l”).


#### Adding a long Actions

Let’s add an action measuring the time between filling the machine with coffee and pushing the button. For that, we convert the ViSibook into a data.frame and add a line for the new action.

```{r,fig.show='asis',fig.width=7, fig.height=5, warning=FALSE}
visi1 <- visielse( X )
book <- ConvertFromViSibook( visi1@book ) # Convert book into data.frame
add_delay <- c( "delay_coffee_push","Preparation","l","6","coffee","push_B")
book[6,] <- add_delay 
book
```

### ViSiElse representation of long actions

ViSiElse represents each individual execution of a long action as an horizontal line when it is done. 

```{r,fig.show='asis',fig.width=7, fig.height=5, warning=FALSE}
visi2 <- visielse( X=X , book=book,informer=NULL)
```


## Green & Black zones 

### Punctuals actions

  Green and black zone are introduced to help visualize time boundaries. To define green and black zone for punctual actions we will add the columns :
  
  * Green Zone: GZDeb and GZFin.
  * Black zone 1: BZBeforeDeb and BZBeforeFin.
  * Black zone 2: BZAfterDeb and BZAfterFin.


#### Fill coffee in the machine should be done between 1min and 2min

```{r,fig.show='asis',fig.width=7, fig.height=5, warning=FALSE}
book$GZDeb <- c(NA,60,NA,NA,NA,NA)
book$GZFin <- c(NA,120,NA,NA,NA,NA)
visi2 <- visielse( X=X , book=book,informer=NULL)
```

#### Fill coffee in the machine should not be done before 30s

```{r,fig.show='asis',fig.width=7, fig.height=5, warning=FALSE}
book$GZDeb <- c(NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA)
book$GZFin <- c(NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA)
book$BZBeforeDeb <- c(NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA)
book$BZBeforeFin <- c(NA,30,NA,NA,NA,NA)
visi2 <- visielse( X=X , book=book,informer=NULL)
```



#### Fill coffee in the machine should be done between the second 1min and 2 min but not before 30s or after 3min

```{r,fig.show='asis',fig.width=7, fig.height=5, warning=FALSE}
book$GZDeb <- c(NA,60,NA,NA,NA,NA)
book$GZFin <- c(NA,120,NA,NA,NA,NA)
book$BZBeforeDeb <- c(NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA)
book$BZBeforeFin <- c(NA,30,NA,NA,NA,NA)
book$BZAfterDeb <- c(NA,180,NA,NA,NA,NA)
book$BZAfterFin <- c(NA,Inf,NA,NA,NA,NA)
visi2 <- visielse( X=X , book=book,informer=NULL)
```

### Long Action 

ViSiElSe allows representation of two types of black zone for long actions:

 * A deadline not to cross : "span"
 * A duration not to exceed : "time"

#### The preparation should not last more than 2min 30s

```{r,fig.show='asis',fig.width=7, fig.height=5, warning=FALSE}
visi1 <- visielse( X,  doplot = FALSE )
book <- ConvertFromViSibook( visi1@book ) # Convert book into data.frame
add_delay <- c( "delay_coffee_push","Preparation","l","6","coffee","push_B")
book[6,] <- add_delay 
book$BZLong <- c(rep(NA,5),150)
book$BZLtype <- c(rep(NA,5),"time")
visi1 <- visielse( X, book=book , informer = NULL)
```

#### The preparation should be done at 2min 30s

```{r,fig.show='asis',fig.width=7, fig.height=5, warning=FALSE}
book$BZLong <- c(rep(NA,5),150)
book$BZLtype <- c(rep(NA,5),"span")
visi1 <- visielse( X, book=book ,informer = NULL)
```


## Group

It might be useful to distinguish groups in the drawing. To define two groups you need to:
  
  * Add a vector containing the group for each individuals
  * Select a method of visualizing groups

ViSiElse proposes three methods to plot two groups:

   * Each groups is represented one under the other with different colors : “cut”
   * Groups are spatially mixed but they are represented by different colors : “join”
   * All individuals executions are represented and under executions of the selected group : “join”

### Method : Cut
Each groups is represented one under the other.

```{r,fig.show='asis',fig.width=7, fig.height=5, warning=FALSE}
group <- c( "group2","group1","group2","group1","group1","group2","group1","group1","group1","group2")
visi1 <- visielse( X,group=group, book=book ,informer = NULL, method = "cut")
```

### Method : Join
Groups are spatially mixed but they are represented by different colors.

```{r,fig.show='asis',fig.width=7, fig.height=5, warning=FALSE}
group <- c( "group1","group1","group1","group1","group1","group2","group2","group2","group2","group2")
visi1 <- visielse( X,group=group, book=book ,informer = NULL, method = "join")
```

### Method : Within
When using the method "Within", for each action, first all individual executions are represented without group distinction and then under it only executions of individuals from the selected group (grwithin) are represented.

```{r,fig.show='asis',fig.width=7, fig.height=5, warning=FALSE}
group <- c( "group2","group1","group2","group1","group1","group2","group1","group1","group1","group2")
visi1 <- visielse( X,group=group, book=book ,informer = NULL, method = "within",grwithin = "group1")
```
