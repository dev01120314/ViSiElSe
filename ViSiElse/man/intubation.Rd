\description{
The dataset called intubation is a sample of SIMULRUN's data. 
SIMULRUN is a research project funded by European funds (FEDER) and focusses on learning processes in simulation in healthcare. This set of data 
corresponds to an intubation procedure of a new-born resuscitation during a high fidelity simulation.
}
\details{
The process is composed of three punctual actions and one long action : \itemize{
\item{ time_in_intub :} { The time when the blade is in the mouth.}
\item{ time_insert_probe :}{ The time when the tube is inserted into the mouth.}
\item{ time_out_intub :} { The time when the blade is out of the mouth.}
\item{ delay_intub_prob :} { The delay between the time when the blade is in 
the mouth and when the tube is inserted into the mouth.}
}
